# Parameters for simulation
All parameters are written as the key for use and possible values. All assigned values are representing default Covasim parameters. Some of those parameters are not implemented and tested yet - look for their description in each section. TO DO: What does this mean? Some parameters do not need to use, because they are already used by another module.

## Admissible parameters for global settings
- use_waning   = True **(bool)** - **(Optional)** Whether to use dynamically calculated immunity. **Must be enabled if there are vaccine intervention**
- unique_mobility_indexes = True **(bool)** As from the *V0.2.4* this must be enabled. Future fix coming.
- start_day = '2020-03-01' **str** - **(Optional)** Date from when the simulation is started. *Can be combined as start_day and n_days. Do not need to specify end_day.*
- n_days = 180 **int** - number of days for simulation

## Population parameters
- pop_size     = (int) e.g. 20000 or 20e3 - Number of agents, **Do not use when there is population object loaded**
- pop_infected = (int) 20 - Number of initial infections - **Can be used Globally or separately**
- pop_type     = 'random' - What type of population data to use -- 'random' (fastest), 'synthpops' (best), 'hybrid' (compromise) **Don not use when there is population object loaded**
- location     = None     - What location to load data from -- default Seattle **Do not use when there is population object loaded**

## Simulation parameters

- end_day    = None **(Datetime (YYYY-MM-DD))**- **(Optional)** End day of the simulation - can be used with `start_day`. *Does not need to be specified when there is start_day and n_days*
- n_days     = 60 **(int)** - Number of days to run, if `end_day` is not specified. *Simulation can only have n_days and starts with default date and ends after las day from n_days* 
- rand_seed  = 1 **(int)** - **(Optional)** Random seed, if None, do not reset *Simulation is using some random values, use rand_seed for different random seed*
- verbose    = cvo.verbose  - **(Optional)** Whether or not to display information during the run -- options are 0 (silent), 0.1 (some; default), 1 (default), 2 (everything). *It signifanctly slower simulation process*

## Rescaling parameters
Rescaling parameters do not need to be used. Some intervention have problem with rescaling (for example, contact tracing).

- pop_scale         = 1 **(int)** -**(Optional)** Factor by which to scale the population -- e.g. `pop_scale`=10 with `pop_size`=100e3 means a population of 1 million. **Cannot be used with interventions for contact tracing**

- rescale           = True **(bool)** - Enable dynamic rescaling of the population -- starts with `pop_scale`=1 and scales up dynamically as the epidemic grows. **Use the default, so no need to explicitly specify**
- rescale_threshold = 0.05 **(float)** - Fraction susceptible population that will trigger rescaling (if rescaling enabled)
- rescale_factor    = 1.2  **(float**- Factor by which the population is rescaled on each step

There is a plenty of `key:values` which are optional. Basically it is necessary to define `daily_test` and type of intervention. Everything else is optional and be loaded as default parameters, if none provided. (Default parameters are written on every key = default_value). **Note: do not use dict value specific keys, this is not tested yet e.g. *keys: trace_probs and trace_time otherwise use them only as single float value* **

- location_code **(str)** = location code of region
- use **(bool)** = True # Default value for use is **True**. If you want to disable this intervention, set it to **False**
- intervention_type **(str)*** = "contact_tracing" # Default value for type is **contact_tracing**. No other value allowed.
- label **(str)** = "Some label"  **Optional** # Label for this mobility change eg. "School contact isolation"
- trace_probs **(float/dict)**=0.4 **Optional** probability of tracing, per layer (default=100%, i.e. everyone is traced) **NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**
- trace_time  **(float/dict)**=0 **Optional** days required to trace, per layer (default=0, i.e. no delay) **NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**
- start_day   **(int)**=0       **Optional** intervention start day (default=0, i.e. the start of the simulation)
- end_day     **(int)**=None       **Optional** intervention end day (default=no end)
- presumptive **(bool)**=false      **Optional** whether or not to begin isolation and contact tracing on the presumption of a positive diagnosis (default=no)
- capacity    **(int)**=None       **Optional** optionally specify a maximum number of newly diagnosed people to trace each day
- quar_period **(int)**=None       **Optional** number of days to quarantine when notified as a known contact.
- num_days **(int/list of ints)** = can be specified for starting/ending day. Usage as list or integer: [10,25] or 10

## Parameters for simple vaccination
There are a few keys to define this intervention. Use waning immunity must be enabled.

- location_code **(str)** = location code of region
- use **(bool)** = True # Default value for use is **True**. If you want to disable this intervention, set it to **False**
- intervention_type **(str)** = "simple_vaccination" # Default value for type is **vaccine**. No other value allowed.
- label **(str)** = "Some label"  **Optional** # Label for this mobility change eg. "School contact isolation"
- start_day **(int)** = 0       **Optional** intervention start day (default=0, i.e. the start of the simulation)
- end_day **(int)** = None       **Optional** intervention end day (default=no end)
- num_days **(int/list of ints)** = can be specified for starting/ending day. Usage as list or integer: [10,25] or 10
- prob **(float)** = 0.0       **Optional** probability of being vaccinated each day (default=0, i.e. no one is vaccinated)
- rel_sus **(float)** = 0.0       **Optional** relative susceptibility of vaccinated people (0 = perfect, 1 = no effect)
- rel_symp **(float)** = 0.0       **Optional** relative symptomaticity of vaccinated people (0 = perfect, 1 = no effect)
- cumulative **(bool)** = False       **Optional** whether cumulative doses have cumulative effects (default false);
