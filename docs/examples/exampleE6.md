# Reporting module

Reporting module serves for creating user-friendly data reports from simulations. It is based on outputs generated by the base covasim model. More information about module configuration options can be found at [Report_settings](../Report_settings.md)

## Which outputs are generated by default?

If this module is enabled, it is responsible for creating the basic output in `*.xlsx` or `*.csv` files. Those files are created for all basic covasim parameters for the whole simulation and for every region separately. Outputs also differentiated for each variant created.

## How to generate optional outputs?

You can also generate more specific output files for selected parameters by defining custom reports in the configuration file. More info about configuration file can be found in [Report_settings](../Report_settings.md)

## Recommendations 

You can use Zeppelin with the pre-generated report files in the report module.
Alternatively, you can load the whole output simulation file and use Apache Zeppelin. 
Of course, any other programming language like R or python can be used for your own research.
Finally, you can import the covasim module and use its functions for sophisticated data analysis.
